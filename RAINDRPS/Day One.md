- [DayOne to Obsidian script - Share & showcase - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/dayone-to-obsidian-script/13387) - Ive finished a Python script that takes a DayOne JSON export and converts to individual .md files for use in an Obsidian Vault.  It meets my needs and is unlikely to be modified much further but Im sharing it as I think its useful and others can modify to their own tastes.

- [How are you using Day One these days? - Software - MPU Talk](https://talk.macpowerusers.com/t/how-are-you-using-day-one-these-days/9947/6) - I started journaling yesterday (March 1) with DayOne, so my opinion isnt worth much. That said, I will probably use it like @bowline - just for daily text entry. Maybe a photo but I rarely take pictures. Therefore, I am not getting the subscription, which will limit my journaling to just my home laptop. But hey, analogue people limit their journaling to a single notebook so its not much different.  Writing what happened today and how you feel about it has already been very helpful. I think tha...

I like planning my next day in the evening. I like tracking how my day is going and what I spend my time on. Yes, I care about all these things and to make sure I do them consistently I prepared a Siri Shortcut (iOS only, sorry!) that helps me do just that! I hope youll also find it useful:

- [Using the Day One CLI with Day One 2](http://help.dayoneapp.com/using-the-day-one-cli-with-day-one-2) - /Day One (2.0) /Mac / Using the Day One CLI with Day One 2 The Day One command line tool was originally written to work with Day One Classic, and by default writes its entries to the default Day One Classic journal directory1. If you want to use this tool to write entries in Day One 2 instead, there are a couple options. Option 1. Use this option if you dont use Day One Classic at all. Modify the settings file for Day One Classic to automatically use the Day One 2 auto-import journal instead. Run the following command in Terminal: defaults write "$HOME/Library/Group Containers/5U8NS4GX82.dayoneapp/Data/Preferences/dayone.plist" JournalPackageURL "$HOME/Library/Group Containers/5U8NS4GX82.dayoneapp2/Data/Auto Import/Default Journal.dayone" Fixed!2 Now the CLI tool will automatically work! echo "This is my new entry" | dayone new Note that Option 1 will break Day One Classic.
