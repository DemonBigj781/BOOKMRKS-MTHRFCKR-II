- [Spookinite Valley](http://spookinite.com/spookinitevalley.htm) - Some secrets shall always rest unseen in the darknessfar from the eyes of any curious mortal. Indeed, Spookinite Valley is the shadow that such secrets are obscured in. And without doubt, the Valleys inhabitants are far from benevolent. For only between the desolate, gloomy mountains, inhospitable nightstalkers, violent ghouls, wrathful phantoms, and their innumerable tales of unutterable horrors lie in wait. Even the most dauntless of souls who dare venture into its uncanny depths will come to the inescapable realization that The Dark Sickness lives freely within the hearts of all. And once this knowledge is obtained, the trespasser will become sullied with the aforementioned morbidity of the heart.
