- [Genesis 0x01: Simplified Roadmap for Blockchain Security](https://devansh.xyz/blockchain-security/2021/09/17/genesis-0x01.html) - Howdy I hope you all are doing well and fine! Welcome to the awesome world of Blockchain Security. As promised in my introductory Genesis 0x00 post, I am back with the first edition of our Genesis Series. For those who dont know what Genesis is; Lets do a quick introduction to this series. Genesis is a series of weekly articles on Blockchain Security, which will include interesting topics such as Blockchain basics, Blockchain Development, Ethereum 101, Building Dapps, Common vulnerabilities in smart contracts, Auditing Solidity source code, Static analysis of Smart contracts, latest news and the future state of DeFi.  Building vs Breaking Without knowing how an application/protocol/framework is built or structured, we cannot proceed further with its security audit or find any vulnerabilities in it, however, If you do manage to find actual vulnerabilities in a smart contract or any blockchain protocol, without having any prior knowledge of how it is built and structured; You were just throwing arrows in the dark, and got lucky. To a great extent, your ability to break into an application is directly proportional to your understanding of how that application is built and structured, that said we will be focusing on blockchain development before we jump to the security aspects related to it. This article will be laying down a path/roadmap for us, following which we will enter into the field of Blockchain Security together . All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to your destination. - Earl Nightingale The only Roadmap you need This Roadmap is not exhaustive, but it is organized and covers all rudimentary topics that one needs to know in order to get into the field of Blockchain Security. It also acts as a guide to our future articles in Genesis Series. Note: I handpicked these topics and links to the resources listed below, all of these resources are 100% free. In my coming articles in the Genesis Series, we will be starting from Blockchain Basics (skipping rudimentary topics such as basics of internet, Web2.0 security, etc). Elementary Topics: Familiarity with Linux OS. Understanding of commonly used bash commands. Understanding of version control systems such as Git ,Github, Gitlab , etc. What is CI/CD pipeline. JavaScript. Python. Good understanding of Object Oriented programming. Familiarity with Package Managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, pip). Basics of Internet: Good understanding of Networking concepts.

What is Integer Overflow and Underflow. What is Floating Pragma. What is Unchecked Call Return Value. What is Unprotected SELFDESTRUCT Instruction. State Variable Default Visibility. What is Uninitialized Storage Pointer. Use of Deprecated Solidity Functions. DoS with Failed Call. Authorization through tx.origin Signature Malleability. Weak Sources of Randomness from Chain Attributes. Lack of Proper Signature Verification. Missing Protection against Signature Replay Attacks. Insufficient Gas Griefing. DoS With Block Gas Limit. Hash Collisions With Multiple Variable Length Arguments. Message call with hardcoded gas amount. Oracle Manipulation. Static and Dynamic Analysis: Oyente Octopus Vertigo MythX Mythril Slither Echidna Blockchain CTFs: Openzeppelins Ethernaut. Damn Vulnerable DeFi. Smart Contract CTF. Capture the Ether. GOATCasino. Paradigm CTF. Bug Bounty Platforms with Crypto Programs: Immunefi HackerOne Bugcrowd The future of Ethereum: What is Ethereum 2.0.  Bonus For your convenience in tracking your progress while following the above roadmap, I am sharing a publicly readable version of my Notion notes, which you can copy it to your own Notion notebook as a template for tracking your progress.
