- [The All New DEVONthink To Go for iOS](http://www.macdrifter.com/2016/09/the-all-new-devonthink-to-go-for-ios.html) - Every year there's one or two iOS apps that really elevate the platform to a new level for me. In the early days it was Tweetbot and iThoughts. Then it was Evernote and Editorial, and Workflow. More recently, scanning applications like Scanner Pro or Scanbot have been tremendous new tools.

- [Copied 2.0 MacStories](https://www.macstories.net/news/copied-2-0) - starred items / via Inoreader perso https://www.macstories.net/news/copied-2-0/ September 16, 2016 at 10:32PM There's a great update to Copied, my favorite clipboard manager for iOS, released on the App Store today. I've been using Copied since version 1.0 and it's a good example of an iCloud-based app that has always worked reliably (same with Ulysses). I use Copied to store bits of text and images and keep them synced across devices. Just this past week, I stored several shortcode templates in Copied for the special formatting of my iOS 10 review. I love the app. I haven't had time to properly test the new version yet, but based on a few minutes of playing around with it, I think it has some terrific enhancements. The widget has been redesigned for iOS 10 and it can show more clippings at once. You can now create text formatters (with templates or JavaScript) to reformat text in specific ways before pasting it. There are rules to save clippings into lists based on text matches. There's a built-in Safari View Controller browser and both extensions (action and custom keyboard) have been rewritten with text formatter integration. There's a lot to try in the latest Copied, and I'm already considering some text formatter scripts for my Markdown workflows. Copied 2.0 is a free update on the App Store.  Source: itunes.apple.com

- [iOS 10 is a major shift for iOS The Brooks Review](https://brooksreview.net/2016/09/ios-10) - Ben Brooks: Lets take a normal scenario to see how iOS changes things. My wife and I have been looking at houses on Zillow. Typically, for me, that means [in iOS 9] a lot of copy and pasting, or other hijinks to get a satellite view from Apple Maps (I can do it in the app, but I like to see images hopefully taken at different times  Im odd like that, but I have reasons). Its even worse when I wanted to drive by these places because I would constantly be switching apps and pasting in addresses. With iOS 10 this changes a lot, now Maps knows what house and address I have been looking at, and it prompts me to use that address in Maps. Now the workflow is: look at house in Zillow, move to Maps, and tap the address suggested. No copying and pasting, it just is there, and there without Zillow being updated for iOS 10. It was also crazy that the fastest way to get directions to the next event on your calendar, was by tapping the location field in Calendar, not from within Maps  completely counter intuitive. Under iOS 10, this again changes, now Maps knows that the location is on the calendar, is your next event, and puts the address one tap away inside of Maps  where it should have been the entire time. Theres a lot of little things like this, because for once iOS knows what the other hand is doing and its about time. This is one of the biggest reasons why I say that iOS 10 is going to be a tipping point  because now iOS has tangible usability benefits over macOS. Limited still, yes, but significantly better in many ways also. I hadn't noticed that (yet) in iOS 10, and of course the next Mac OSX update (to become MacOS) brings some more cross-platform integration (such as the clipboard, and Apple Watch unlock). But iOS is definitely getting things Mac OS isn't.

Day One 2.0 was supposed to take one year of development but spanned two years unexpectedly. For a team of a dozen developers, this is a huge project. As an engineer myself, just seeing you guys pull off a cloud syncing platform, a universal iOS application (iPhone + iPad), a watchOS app, and a Mac application all with full-fledged functionality leaves me no doubt that this is an excellent team equipped with amazing weapons of productivity.
