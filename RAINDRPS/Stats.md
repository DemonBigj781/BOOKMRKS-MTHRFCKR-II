- [Git Quick Stats](https://git-quick-stats.sh) - Any git repository may contain tons of information about commits, contributors, and files. Extracting this information is not always trivial, mostly because there are a gadzillion options to a gadzillion git commands  I dont think there is a single person alive who knows them all. Probably not even Linus Torvalds himself :).
