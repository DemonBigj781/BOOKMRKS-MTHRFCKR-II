- [Data to Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_YRs28yBYuI) - Cifas, the UK’s leading fraud prevention service, has released new figures showing a 52% rise in young identity fraud victims in the UK.

Data to Go is a short film which aims to raise awareness of this identity fraud. Filmed in a London coffee shop in March this year, the film uses hidden cameras to capture baffled reactions from people caught in a stunt where their personal data, all found on public websites, is revealed to them live on a coffee cup.
More information about the campaign here: www.identityfraud.org.uk
