[Genesis 0x01: Simplified Roadmap for Blockchain Security](https://devansh.xyz/blockchain-security/2021/09/17/genesis-0x01.html) - Howdy I hope you all are doing well and fine! Welcome to the awesome world of Blockchain Security. As promised in my introductory Genesis 0x00 post, I am back with the first edition of our Genesis Series. For those who dont know what Genesis is; Lets do a quick introduction to this series. Genesis is a series of weekly articles on Blockchain Security, which will include interesting topics such as Blockchain basics, Blockchain Development, Ethereum 101, Building Dapps, Common vulnerabilities in smart contracts, Auditing Solidity source code, Static analysis of Smart contracts, latest news and the future state of DeFi.  Building vs Breaking Without knowing how an application/protocol/framework is built or structured, we cannot proceed further with its security audit or find any vulnerabilities in it, however, If you do manage to find actual vulnerabilities in a smart contract or any blockchain protocol, without having any prior knowledge of how it is built and structured; You were just throwing arrows in the dark, and got lucky. To a great extent, your ability to break into an application is directly proportional to your understanding of how that application is built and structured, that said we will be focusing on blockchain development before we jump to the security aspects related to it. This article will be laying down a path/roadmap for us, following which we will enter into the field of Blockchain Security together . All you need is the plan, the road map, and the courage to press on to your destination. - Earl Nightingale The only Roadmap you need This Roadmap is not exhaustive, but it is organized and covers all rudimentary topics that one needs to know in order to get into the field of Blockchain Security. It also acts as a guide to our future articles in Genesis Series. Note: I handpicked these topics and links to the resources listed below, all of these resources are 100% free. In my coming articles in the Genesis Series, we will be starting from Blockchain Basics (skipping rudimentary topics such as basics of internet, Web2.0 security, etc). Elementary Topics: Familiarity with Linux OS. Understanding of commonly used bash commands. Understanding of version control systems such as Git ,Github, Gitlab , etc. What is CI/CD pipeline. JavaScript. Python. Good understanding of Object Oriented programming. Familiarity with Package Managers (npm, yarn, pnpm, pip). Basics of Internet: Good understanding of Networking concepts. How a Web Browser works. What is DNS (What happens behind the scenes when you type google.com in web browser). What is HTTP Protocol and how it works. What are HTTP Request and Response headers. What is RPC Protocol. Familiarity with Browsers developer tools. Web2.0 (how a typical Web2.0 application is packaged and deployed). Existing Authentication/Authorization models in Web2.0 applications. SSO  Single Sign On OAuth  Open Authorization JWT Authentication Token Based Authentication Session Based Authentication Basic Authentication What is HTTP Caching. Web 2.0 Security: OWASP Top 10: Broken Access Control vulnerabilities. Cryptographic Failures. Injection vulnerabilities. Insecure Design. Security Misconfigurations. Vulnerable and Outdated Components. Identification and Authentication Failures. Software and Data Integrity Failures. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures. Server-Side Request Forgery. Basics of Blockchain: What is Asymmetric Cryptography. What is Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Understanding of commonly used words in Blockchain world, such as Programmable, Distributed, Decentralized, Immutable, Unanimous, Time-Stamped, etc. Bitcoin Whitepaper. What is Double-spending problem and how bitcoin solves it. What is Consensus Algorithm. Proof of work vs Proof of stake. What is Bitcoin Mining and how ASIC is better than regular mining gig.

Paradigm CTF. Bug Bounty Platforms with Crypto Programs: Immunefi HackerOne Bugcrowd The future of Ethereum: What is Ethereum 2.0.  Bonus For your convenience in tracking your progress while following the above roadmap, I am sharing a publicly readable version of my Notion notes, which you can copy it to your own Notion notebook as a template for tracking your progress.
