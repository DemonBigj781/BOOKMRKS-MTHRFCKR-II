[GitHub tools collection](https://10degres.net/github-tools-collection) - This is the current thread in the bug hunter community: how to find sensitive informations on GitHub. Understand how to find tokens/keys/passwords on the largest code database in the world in order to pwn a company and get massive rewards. Using tools or doing it manually, some very talented people like Th3G3nt3lman are real wizards when it comes to discover such treasures. Many tools are now available but since I wanted to learn Python for a long time, I jumped at the opportunity. In this article Im going to present some scripts I wrote in PHP and Python to fit my needs.
