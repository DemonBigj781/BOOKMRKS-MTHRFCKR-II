[Imgur API](https://apidocs.imgur.com/?ref=apislist.com) - ## API Status  Status for the API can be found at [status.imgur.com](http://status.imgur.com)!  ## Getting Started  Imgur's API exposes the entire Imgur infrastructure via a standardized programmatic interface. Using Imgur's API, you can do just about anything you can do on imgur.com, while using your programming language of choice. The Imgur API is a RESTful API based on HTTP requests and JSON responses.

It also means that you need to register your application, even if you aren't allowing users to login.  The easiest way to start using the Imgur API is by clicking the **Run in Postman** button above. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a free tool which helps developers run and debug API requests, and is the source of truth for this documentation. Every endpoint you see documented here is readily available by running our Postman collection.  ## Exampl…
