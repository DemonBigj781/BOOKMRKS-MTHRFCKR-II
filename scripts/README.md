# Instructions

---

I use VS Code but you can use whatever code editor you want.

## Note

---

    In order for this script to work, you must have these columns: cover,title,url,excerpt,created,tags

- Place this script wherever you want.
- Open the folder in your editor where you placed the script.
- In your Terminal run `python csvtomd.py` and hit enter. This will ask you to input the path to your CSV file.
- Enter your CSV path and hit enter.

Thats it! The script will output to a markdown file with the same name and in the same directory as your CSV file. 

The results of the markdown file will look like this for each bookmark.
